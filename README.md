### Contents

* Directory **1_Simulations_across_hall_of_fame_models** contains all necessary data, algorithms, and results for main **Figure 5 a-b**, and supplementary **Figure S9**.

* Directory **2_Cell_calibration_and_conductance_correlation** contains all necessary data, algorithms, and results for main **Figure 5 c**, and supplementary **Figure S8**.

> Most simulations are configured to run on a separate drive and will seek for path **R:\Temp** to exist. (Optionally you can set it as a **RAM drive** - see https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/).
